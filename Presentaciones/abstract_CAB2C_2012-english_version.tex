\section*{Background}

The body of knowledge in biology, particularly in virology and immunology,
is increasing in volume and complexity. This is why it would be useful
to have these knowledge represented in a formal language inside a
knowledge base. Subsequently, different methodologies for analysis
and manipulation could be developed, allowing validity checks to be
performed on conclusions obtained in experiments.

FuDePAN's Logic processor (FuL) (\url{http://ful.googlecode.com})
is being developed to organize, interpret, verify and explore knowledge
in molecular biology, applied to virology and immunology in particular.
This will help find inconsistencies and automatically derive new information.
Its main function will be the verification of conclusions obtained
by results from experiments using queries.

Our initial test case will be the following conclusion obtained from
experiments done by FuDePAN: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\emph{Validate the conclusions obtained in the Junin experiment
about the temperature-change effects over the virus secondary structure:}}\\
 Corroborate that the line of thought that includes the predictions
of the effects of febrile state over the Junin RNA secondary structure,
in which it is hypothesized that the temperature increment reduces
the production of nucleoproteins because the hairpin loop in the intergenic
region presents dissimilar characteristics when it is compared on
the two ambisense genome strings when the temperature is increased. 
\end{itemize}
FuL has a plug-in architecture, simplifying the inclusion of new kinds
of reasoning services. An API will be provided, which defines the
way in which knowledge flows between the plug-ins and FuL's core reasoning
engine. An SDK composed of libraries and tools required for building
plug-ins will also be made available.

The kernel of the tool will be composed of a planner that can handle
PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) input, and a knowledge
manager that will be the interface between the plug-ins registered
in that session and the planner. Via a XML file, it will be possible
to register the plug-ins that FuL will utilize in that session and
configure different session parameters.

FuL will include a semantic reasoner for Description Logics (DL) as
one of the plug-ins, and we will also provide a knowledge representation
language for the virology domain based on DL. This language will allow
the development of an ontology of virology knowledge that will be
available for querying during a FuL session.
